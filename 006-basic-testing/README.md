# 006 - Basic Testing

This example was solved with [`karma`][1] as the test runner and [`jasmine`][2] to write the tests, using example [003 - Servers and Maps][3] as the base to develop the following tests:

*  Test of Weather Service
*  Test of Weather Controller

Tests can be found in the file .spec.js of each one.

The final Coverage Report is at 100%

* coverage test result can be found in: `/coverage/PhantomJs***/index.html`

### What is needed?
