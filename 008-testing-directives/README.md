# 008 - Testing Directives

This example was solved with Karma as the test runner and Jasmine to write the test, using example [004 - Directives][1].

### To test the Directive is necesary

* Create an `element` that contains a html code using the directive.
* Use $compile to render the `element`
* Test card with fields using `.find`
